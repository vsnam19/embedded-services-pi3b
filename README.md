# Embedded C++20 Services for Raspberry Pi 3B

This repository contains embedded Linux services and applications written in C++20, specifically designed for Raspberry Pi 3B deployment.

## Overview

This repository provides C++20-based system services, daemons, and embedded applications optimized for Pi 3B hardware constraints and embedded Linux environments.

## Components

### System Services (C++20)
- **Hardware monitoring**: Temperature, CPU usage, GPIO status monitoring
- **Resource management**: Memory, storage, process management services
- **Communication services**: Serial, I2C, SPI interface daemons
- **Network services**: Wi-Fi management, Bluetooth integration

### Embedded Applications (C++20)
- **Device control**: GPIO manipulation using modern C++ interfaces
- **Sensor integration**: Hardware sensor data collection with C++20 coroutines
- **System utilities**: Embedded-specific tools using C++20 features
- **Performance monitoring**: Real-time system performance tracking

### Hardware Abstraction Layer
- **GPIO wrapper**: Modern C++ GPIO interface for Pi 3B
- **I2C/SPI drivers**: C++20-based communication protocols
- **Sensor libraries**: Template-based sensor data handling
- **Device management**: RAII-based hardware resource management

## Integration with Yocto

These services are packaged as Yocto recipes in the meta-custom layer:

```bash
# Build embedded services into Pi 3B image
bitbake rpi3-custom-image

# Include specific services in your image
IMAGE_INSTALL += "embedded-monitor"
IMAGE_INSTALL += "gpio-controller"
```

## Hardware Requirements

- **Target**: Raspberry Pi 3B
- **Architecture**: ARM Cortex-A53 (64-bit)
- **Memory**: Optimized for 1GB RAM
- **Storage**: microSD card deployment
- **Interfaces**: GPIO, I2C, SPI, UART support

## Development Workflow

1. **Service Development**:
   ```bash
   # Develop within Yocto container
   uv run yocto-env enter
   cd services/
   ```

2. **Recipe Integration**:
   - Services are packaged as Yocto recipes
   - Installed into embedded Linux filesystem
   - Configured for systemd startup

3. **Hardware Testing**:
   - Deploy to Pi 3B hardware
   - Validate on actual embedded system
   - Performance optimization for embedded constraints
